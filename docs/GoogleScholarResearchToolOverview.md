# Google Scholar Research Tool - System Definition

## 1. System Overview

The Google Scholar Research Tool is a comprehensive Python-based application designed to automate the extraction, analysis, and visualization of academic research data from Google Scholar. It provides researchers with capabilities for advanced search, author profile analysis, PDF downloading, and citation network visualization, all while handling the complexities of web scraping such as CAPTCHA detection, proxy rotation, and rate limiting.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Module Architecture

The system is built using a modular architecture with the following key components:

1. **QueryBuilder**: Constructs properly formatted URLs for Google Scholar search queries
2. **ProxyManager**: Manages a pool of proxies with performance tracking and rotation
3. **Parser**: Extracts structured data from Google Scholar search result pages
4. **AuthorProfileParser**: Extracts data from Google Scholar author profile pages
5. **Fetcher**: Handles all HTTP operations with error handling and retry logic
6. **DataHandler**: Manages data persistence and export operations
7. **GraphBuilder**: Creates and visualizes citation networks
8. **Utility Functions**: Provides support for delays, user-agent rotation, and CAPTCHA detection

### 2.2 Data Flow

1. User provides search parameters via command-line interface
2. QueryBuilder constructs appropriate Google Scholar URL
3. Fetcher obtains proxy from ProxyManager and makes HTTP request
4. Parser or AuthorProfileParser extracts structured data from HTML response
5. DataHandler stores extracted data in SQLite database
6. Optional: PDF downloading for available articles
7. Optional: Citation network building and visualization
8. Results exported to CSV/JSON based on user preferences

### 2.3 Error Handling Hierarchy

The system implements a robust error handling hierarchy:

1. **Custom Exceptions**:
   - `CaptchaException`: For CAPTCHA detection events
   - `ParsingException`: For HTML parsing failures
   - `NoProxiesAvailable`: When proxy pool is exhausted

2. **Recovery Mechanisms**:
   - Proxy rotation on failure
   - Exponential backoff for retries
   - Performance tracking to prioritize reliable proxies
   - Graceful degradation for unavailable data elements

## 3. System Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

1. **Search Capabilities**:
   - Basic keyword search
   - Author-specific search
   - Publication-specific search
   - Year range filtering
   - Phrase matching
   - Keyword exclusion
   - Field-specific search (title, author, source)
   - Citation count filtering

2. **Author Profile Analysis**:
   - Author details extraction (name, affiliation, interests)
   - Co-authors list retrieval
   - Citation metrics (h-index, i10-index)
   - Publications list with metadata

3. **Data Collection**:
   - PDF downloading with multiple fallback methods
   - Citation network building
   - Structured data extraction for academic papers

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Citation network visualization with multiple layouts
   - Centrality-based filtering
   - Graph persistence in GraphML format

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**:
   - Asynchronous operations for high concurrency
   - Progress tracking with real-time statistics
   - Estimated time remaining calculation

2. **Robustness**:
   - CAPTCHA detection
   - Smart proxy rotation
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Error handling and logging

3. **Data Management**:
   - Duplicate prevention
   - Structured data storage
   - Multiple export formats (CSV, JSON)

## 4. Dependencies

### 4.1 External Libraries

- **Network Operations**: aiohttp
- **Database Management**: aiosqlite, sqlite3
- **Data Processing**: pandas
- **Network Analysis**: networkx
- **Visualization**: matplotlib
- **Web Parsing**: parsel
- **UI/Progress**: tqdm, colorama
- **Proxy Management**: free-proxy
- **User-Agent Rotation**: fake-useragent

### 4.2 External Services

- **Google Scholar**: Primary data source
- **Unpaywall API**: For locating open access PDFs
- **Publisher Websites**: Secondary sources for PDF retrieval

## 5. Constraints and Limitations

1. **Legal and Ethical**:
   - Google Scholar Terms of Service compliance concerns
   - Academic publication copyright considerations

2. **Technical**:
   - CAPTCHA challenges may interrupt scraping
   - Free proxies are often unreliable
   - Google Scholar's HTML structure may change
   - Rate limiting by Google's servers

3. **Performance**:
   - Network operations are inherently subject to latency
   - PDF downloading can be time-consuming
   - Large citation networks may require significant memory

## 6. Deployment Model

The system is designed as a command-line application with the following deployment considerations:

1. **Environment**: Python 3.8+ with virtualenv recommended
2. **Configuration**: Command-line arguments for runtime behavior
3. **Persistence**: SQLite database for data storage
4. **File System**: Local storage for PDFs and graph visualizations
5. **Logging**: Configurable logging levels for debugging and monitoring

## 7. Future Enhancements

Potential areas for system expansion include:

1. **Web Interface**: GUI for easier interaction
2. **API Integration**: Expose functionality through REST API
3. **CAPTCHA Solving**: Integration with CAPTCHA solving services
4. **Enhanced Analysis**: Text mining of downloaded PDFs
5. **Premium Proxy Support**: Integration with commercial proxy services
